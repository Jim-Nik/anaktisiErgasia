"Giannis Sina Ugo Antetokounmpo[a] (né Adetokunbo;[b] born December 6, 1994) is a Greek and Nigerian professional basketball player for the Milwaukee Bucks of the National Basketball Association (NBA). His size, speed, strength, and country of origin have earned him the nickname ""Greek Freak"". He is widely regarded as one of the greatest power forwards of all time as well as one of the greatest players of all time.[2][3][4][5][6][7]"
"Born and raised in Athens to Nigerian parents, Antetokounmpo began playing basketball for the youth teams of Filathlitikos in Athens. In 2011, he began playing for the club's senior team before entering the 2013 NBA draft, where he was selected 15th overall by the Bucks. In 2016–17, he led the Bucks in all five major statistical categories and became the first player in NBA history to finish a regular season in the top 20 in all five statistics: total points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks.[8] He received the Most Improved Player award in 2017. Antetokounmpo has received eight All-Star selections, including being selected as an All-Star captain in 2019, 2020, 2023 and 2024 as he led the Eastern Conference in voting in these four years."
"One of the most decorated players in NBA history,[9] Antetokounmpo won consecutive NBA Most Valuable Player Awards in 2019 and 2020, joining Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and LeBron James as the only players in NBA history to win two MVPs before turning 26. Along with his MVP award, he was named the NBA Defensive Player of the Year in 2020, becoming only the third player, after Michael Jordan (1988) and Hakeem Olajuwon (1994), to win both awards in the same season. In 2021, Antetokounmpo led the Bucks to their first NBA championship since 1971 and was named Finals MVP.[10] The same year, he was honored as one of the league's greatest players of all time by being named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team.[11] The film Rise, based on the life of Antetokounmpo and his family, was released in 2022. In 2024, he led the Bucks to win the 2nd edition of the NBA Cup, where he  was named NBA Cup MVP."
"For his sporting achievements in his discipline, on July 10, 2024, the Greek Olympic Committee designated him as the flag bearer for the Paris 2024 Olympic Games, along with the Greek race walker Antigoni Drisbioti.[12]"
"As the son of immigrants from Nigeria,[13][14][15] Giannis Sina Ugo Adetokunbo[16][17] was born in Athens, Greece, on December 6, 1994.[18] His father was a soccer player and his mother was a high jumper in Nigeria. Three years earlier, they had moved from Lagos, leaving their firstborn son, Francis, under the care of his grandparents.[19] Adetokunbo grew up in the Athens neighborhood of Sepolia[15] in a primarily Nigerian household.[20] His parents, as immigrants without work permits,[21] could not easily find work, so Giannis and his older brother Thanasis helped by hawking watches, handbags, and sunglasses in the streets.[22] In 2007, Adetokunbo started playing basketball.[23]"
"Although Adetokunbo and three of his four brothers were born in Greece, they did not automatically receive Greek citizenship as Greek nationality law follows jus sanguinis.[14] Growing up, he sometimes felt like an outsider to both the Greek and Nigerian communities in Athens due to his parents' heritage and different skin color in the former, and due to his lack of understanding of the Yoruba or Igbo languages in the latter.[24] For the first 18 years of his life, Adetokunbo could not travel outside the country and was effectively stateless, having no papers from Greece or Nigeria.[23] He was eventually issued Greek citizenship on May 9, 2013,[25] less than two months before the NBA draft.[23]"
"After gaining Greek citizenship, his official surname became Αντετοκούνμπο, the Greek transcription of Adetokunbo, which was then transliterated letter-for-letter and officially spelled on his Greek passport as Antetokounmpo.[26][27] Giannis is a Modern Greek variant of Ioannes (John).[28] Because many NBA fans could not pronounce his surname, he quickly became known as the ""Greek Freak"".[29][30] Antetokounmpo also holds Nigerian citizenship,[16] having received his Nigerian passport in 2015,[20] and as such possesses dual citizenship.[31][32] He has stated that he feels both Greek and Nigerian[24] and that he embraces both his Greek, as well as his African/Nigerian identity.[20]"
Antetokounmpo played with the senior men's team of Filathlitikos in the semi-pro Greek B Basket League (Third Division) during the 2011–12 season.[33]
"In December 2012, a few days after turning 18, Antetokounmpo signed a four-year deal with Spanish club CAI Zaragoza,[34] reportedly including NBA buyouts after each season. Several other major European clubs had been interested in adding him, including Barcelona and Anadolu Efes.[14]"
"During the 2012–13 Greek A2 League season, Antetokounmpo shot 46.4% from the field (62.1% on two-point field goals), 31.3% from three-point range, and 72.0% from the free throw line, while averaging 22.5 minutes per game. Over 26 games, he averaged 9.5 points, 5.0 rebounds, 1.4 assists, and 1.0 blocks per game.[35] He was also selected by the coaches as a special participant in the 2013 Greek League All-Star Game. Even though he was not selected as an all-star, the coaches let him play in the game as a treat for the fans, since he was in attendance at the game.[36] However, he did not get officially counted as an all-star selection, since only players that play in Greece's first division are even eligible to actually be voted to play in the game, and Antetokounmpo was playing in Greece's second division at the time."
"On April 28, 2013, Antetokounmpo officially made himself eligible for the 2013 NBA draft.[37] He fulfilled his draft projections as a first-round pick by being selected 15th overall by the Milwaukee Bucks. On July 30, 2013, he signed his rookie scale contract with the Bucks.[38][39]"
"Antetokounmpo made his NBA debut on October 13, 2013, at the age of 18 years, 311 days, as one of the youngest NBA players ever. He averaged 6.8 points, 4.4 rebounds, 1.9 assists, 0.8 steals, and 0.8 blocks in 77 appearances during his rookie season. He scored in double figures 23 times and grabbed at least 10 rebounds twice, with both efforts resulting in double-doubles. He finished the season with 61 total blocks, which led all NBA rookies, and was the seventh-most by a Bucks rookie in franchise history. He was selected to participate in the Rising Stars Challenge at NBA All-Star Weekend in New Orleans, where he tallied nine points, two rebounds, and two assists in 17 minutes. At the season's end, he was named to the 2013–14 NBA All-Rookie second team.[40]"
"Antetokounmpo's second season with the Bucks saw both individual and team development. On February 6, 2015, he recorded a then career-high 27 points and 15 rebounds in a loss to the Houston Rockets.[41] Three days later, he was named the Eastern Conference Player of the Week for games played February 2–8, earning Player of the Week honors for the first time in his career.[42] He later competed in the 2015 NBA Slam Dunk Contest at NBA All-Star Weekend in New York. On March 9, he scored a then career-high 29 points on 11-of-16 shooting in a loss to the New Orleans Pelicans.[43]"
"In the 2015–16 season, Antetokounmpo developed further individually, upping his scoring average to almost 17 points per game. On November 19, he scored a then career-high 33 points in a loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers.[44] On December 12, he recorded a near triple-double with 11 points, 12 rebounds, and 8 assists, helping the Bucks snap the Golden State Warriors' 24-game unbeaten start to the season with a 108–95 win.[45] On February 22, 2016, Antetokounmpo recorded his first career triple-double with 27 points, 12 rebounds, and 10 assists in a 108–101 win over the Los Angeles Lakers. At 21 years old, he became the youngest Buck to record a triple-double.[46][47]"
"On September 19, 2016, Antetokounmpo agreed to a four-year, $100 million contract extension with the Bucks.[48] Antetokounmpo's fourth year with the Bucks would be his breakout season, as he further increased his statistical output and ascended to stardom. On December 23, he had a then career-high 39 points, eight rebounds, and six assists in a 123–96 win over the Washington Wizards.[49] A couple of weeks later, Antetokounmpo recorded 27 points and 13 rebounds and made his first game-winning buzzer-beater, a 15-foot turnaround jumper which gave the Bucks a 105–104 victory over the New York Knicks.[50] With 25 points against the Knicks on January 6, Antetokounmpo had at least 20 points in his 14th consecutive game, matching the longest streak by a Bucks player since Michael Redd in 2006.[51] On January 19, Antetokounmpo was named a starter on the Eastern Conference All-Star team for the 2017 NBA All-Star Game.[52] At 22 years and 74 days old, he became the youngest player in franchise history to start in an All-Star Game. He also became the first Greek NBA All-Star.[53] In the game, he led the East with 30 points in a 192–182 loss to the West.[54] On April 3, 2017, he was named Eastern Conference Player of the Month for games played in March. The award was the first of Antetokounmpo's career and the first for a Buck since Michael Redd won the award in January 2004.[55] Antetokounmpo helped the Bucks finish an Eastern Conference-best 14–4 in March, the franchise's first calendar month with at least 14 victories since going 16–2 in February 1971. Antetokounmpo led the Bucks in every one of the five major statistical categories (points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks) in the 2016–17 regular season, becoming only the fifth NBA player to do so after Dave Cowens, Scottie Pippen, Kevin Garnett, and LeBron James; Nikola Jokić has since matched it.[56] He also became the first player in NBA history to finish in the top 20 in the league in each of the five major categories in a regular season. As a result of his efforts, Antetokounmpo was named to the All-NBA Second Team, earning his first All-NBA honor.[57] He was also named the recipient of the NBA Most Improved Player Award for the 2016–17 season, becoming the first player in Bucks history to be named Most Improved Player.[58]"
"On April 15, 2017, Antetokounmpo scored a then playoff career-high 28 points in a 97–83 win over the third-seed Toronto Raptors in Game 1 of their first-round playoff series.[59] In Game 5 of the series on April 24, Antetokounmpo set a new playoff career-high with 30 points, but could not lead the Bucks to a win as they lost 118–93 to go down 3–2 in the series.[60] The Bucks went on to lose Game 6 three days later despite a 34-point effort from Antetokounmpo, ending their season.[61]"
"Antetokounmpo began the 2017–18 season on a tear, scoring 175 points over the first five games of the season, including a then career-high 44 points in a 113–110 win over the Portland Trail Blazers.[62] He averaged almost 27 points during the season, earning his second straight All-Star nomination and All-NBA selection,[63] and broke Kareem Abdul Jabbar's franchise record for triple-doubles."
"In Game 1 of the Bucks' first-round playoff series against the Boston Celtics, Antetokounmpo recorded 35 points, 13 rebounds and seven assists in a 113–107 overtime loss.[64] Antetokounmpo's game-winning tip-in in Game 4 equalized the series at two games a piece. However, the Celtics would go on to eliminate the Bucks in seven games, in spite of Antetokounmpo's 22 points and nine rebounds in Game 7.[65]"
"Starting from the 2018–19 season, Antetokounmpo and the Bucks achieved a period of sustained team success. Under new coach Mike Budenholzer, the Bucks began the season with seven consecutive victories and went 25–10 before the New Year.[66][67]"
"Antetokounmpo was critical to this early success, earning the Eastern Conference Player of the Month awards for October, November, December and February.[68][69][70] On March 17, Antetokounmpo scored a then career-high 52 points to go with 16 rebounds in a 130–125 loss to the 76ers.[71][72] He avenged this loss in an April 4 victory where he recorded 45 points and 13 rebounds in a 128–122 win over the 76ers, helping the Bucks clinch the No. 1 seed in the Eastern Conference.[73] Antetokounmpo eventually guided the Bucks to a 60–22 season and the best record in the league. He helped the Bucks advance to the second round of the playoffs for the first time since 2001 after scoring 41 points in a 127–104 win in Game 4 over the Detroit Pistons for a four-game sweep.[74][75] The Bucks went on to reach the Eastern Conference Finals, where they were defeated 4–2 by the eventual champions, the Toronto Raptors, despite winning the first two games.[76] At the 2019 NBA Awards end-of-season night, Antetokounmpo was named the league's Most Valuable Player.[77] He joined Kareem Abdul-Jabbar as the second Bucks player to win MVP and became the third youngest player to win the MVP over the previous 40 seasons, behind Derrick Rose and LeBron James.[78]
Antetokounmpo began the 2019–20 season with a triple-double, recording 30 points, 13 rebounds, and 11 assists in a 117–111 season-opening win over the Houston Rockets on October 24, 2019.[79] On November 25, Antetokounmpo scored a season-high 50 points, along with 14 rebounds, in a 122–118 win over the Utah Jazz.[80] After a December 14 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers, Antetokounmpo had led the Bucks to their 18th straight victory, 2 shy of the franchise record.[81] The winning streak ended on December 16 with a close loss to the Dallas Mavericks, despite Antetokounmpo recording an efficient 48 points and 14 rebounds.[82] On December 19, Antetokounmpo made a career-high five three-pointers to lead Milwaukee over the Western top seed, the Los Angeles Lakers and helped the Bucks claim the NBA's best record at 25–4. On January 23, 2020, Antetokounmpo was named an All-Star Game captain, alongside James, for the second consecutive year.[83][84]"
"During the season postponement that lasted from early March to the end of July, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Antetokounmpo claimed to not have a basketball hoop to practice with.[85] He later clarified that he did have access to a gym and basketball hoop, explaining his earlier comments as a means to ""get a little bit ahead of the competition.""[86] Antetokounmpo and the Bucks resumed their campaign against the Boston Celtics on July 31, where Antetokounmpo led the Bucks to victory with 36 points and 15 rebounds.[87] Although the Bucks finished the seeding games with a 3–5 record, they set the best record in the NBA for the second consecutive year, finishing with a 56–17 record. On August 12, Antetokounmpo was suspended for one game without pay for headbutting Moritz Wagner during a game against the Washington Wizards.[88] During the playoffs, the Bucks advanced to the second round but lost 4–1 to the Miami Heat. In Game 2, the Heat's Jimmy Butler was fouled while shooting by Antetokounmpo as time expired, leading to Butler's game-winning walk-off free throws.[89] Antetokounmpo missed most of Game 4 after re-injuring his right ankle which he twisted in Game 3. Milwaukee won the game, but Antetokounmpo was also out for Game 5, when the Bucks were eliminated.[90]"
"On September 18, 2020, Antetokounmpo won his second consecutive Most Valuable Player award. In doing so, he joined Hakeem Olajuwon and Michael Jordan as the only players to win MVP and NBA Defensive Player of the Year awards in the same season.[91]"
"On December 15, 2020, Antetokounmpo re-signed with the Bucks, coming to terms on a 5-year, $228 million extension, the largest in league history.[92] At the 2021 All-Star Game, he played on the team captained by James and scored 35 points on a perfect 16-of-16 shooting from the field to lead the team to a 170–150 win and became the first non-American to win the All-Star MVP.[93] The Bucks finished the 2020–21 season with a 46–26 record, clinching the third seed in the Eastern Conference. In the first round of the playoffs, they faced a rematch against the Miami Heat. In a stark reversal of their upset loss the prior year, Antetokounmpo led the Bucks to a four-game sweep, closing out the series with his first playoff triple-double in Game 4.[94] Antetokounmpo also led the Bucks to a seven-game series win over the Brooklyn Nets in the Eastern Conference Semifinals, where he averaged 31.9 points, 12.9 rebounds, and 3.6 assists per game. On June 29, 2021, Antetokounmpo suffered an injury to his left knee during the third quarter of Game 4 of the Eastern Conference Finals against the Atlanta Hawks after slamming into Clint Capela and landing awkwardly, resulting in a gruesome hyperextension.[95] Antetokounmpo would not return to the game, and the Bucks lost 110–88.[96] MRI results would later show that he did not suffer any ligament tears.[97] Antetokounmpo was ruled out for both Games 5 and 6 of the Eastern Conference Finals as a result of the knee injury.[98][99] The series returned to Milwaukee at a 2–2 deadlock, yet the Bucks ended up winning both Games 5 and 6 in his absence, advancing to the NBA Finals for the first time in 47 years.[100]"
"Antetokounmpo returned in time for the finals against the resurgent Phoenix Suns.[101] In his Finals debut, he recorded 20 points and 17 rebounds in a 118–108 loss.[102] He then registered back-to-back games with at least 40 points and 10 rebounds in a Game 2 loss and a Game 3 victory,[103][104] joining Shaquille O'Neal in 2000 as the only players to reach those numbers in consecutive Finals games.[104] He also joined Jordan, O'Neal, and James as the only players to put up at least 40 points in back-to-back Finals games in the previous 50 years.[105] The Bucks continued their comeback after having lost the first two games of the series, prevailing in the next four contests. In Game 6, Antetokounmpo recorded 50 points, 14 rebounds and 5 blocks as the Bucks clinched their first championship in 50 years.[106][107] He posted series averages of 35.2 points, 13.2 rebounds, 5.0 assists, 1.2 steals, and 1.8 blocks, and was subsequently named NBA Finals MVP by a unanimous vote.[10] At 26 years, 226 days old, he is the youngest since Kawhi Leonard in 2014 to be named Finals MVP,[108] as well as the first European since Dirk Nowitzki in 2011 to do so.[109] Antetokounmpo also joined Michael Jordan and Hakeem Olajuwon as the only players to have won the MVP, Finals MVP, and Defensive Player of the Year awards during the span of their careers.[110]"
"On October 19, 2021, after receiving his first NBA championship ring in the annual pre-game ceremony, Antetokounmpo recorded 32 points, 14 rebounds, and seven assists in a 127–104 season-opening win over the Nets.[111] On January 13, 2022, Antetokounmpo led the Bucks to a 118–99 win over the Golden State Warriors with 30 points, 12 rebounds, 11 assists, and 3 blocks, leading both teams in such stats,[112] in less than thirty minutes, and became the first player to record multiple 30-point triple-doubles in 30 minutes;[113] he tied Jordan's career mark of 28 triple-doubles, ranking 18th all-time.[114][115] On February 6, in a 137–113 win over the Los Angeles Clippers, Antetokounmpo recorded 28 points, 10 rebounds, and five assists, as the Bucks became the first team in NBA history to see their entire starting lineup recorded at least 15 points, five rebounds, and two three-pointers in the same game.[116][117] On February 8, 2022, in a 131–116 win against the Lakers, Antetokounmpo scored 44 points with 14 rebounds, 8 assists, 2 blocks, and 0 turnovers on 17-of-20 shooting from the field;[118][119] it was his 20 straight game recording at least 25 points.[120] On February 15, Antetokounmpo scored a season-high 50 points and grabbed 14 rebounds on 17-of-21 shooting from the field in a 128–119 win against the Indiana Pacers; it marked only the 12th time in NBA history that a player has scored 50 or more points on 80% shooting or better.[121] On March 29, Antetokounmpo scored 40 points, grabbed 14 rebounds, delivered six assists, and had a game-deciding block on Joel Embiid in the final seconds to lead the Bucks to a 118–116 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers.[122] The following game, Antetokounmpo scored 44 points, grabbed 14 rebounds, and dished out 6 assists in a 120–119 overtime win over the Brooklyn Nets. He passed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to become the career-leading scorer in Bucks franchise history. Antetokounmpo's record-setting 3-pointer forced overtime, and he made two free throws in the final seconds to seal the victory for the Bucks.[123][124] Antetokounmpo finished the regular season with a then career-high 29.9 points, 11.6 rebounds, and 5.8 assists to become the first player in NBA history to average 25 points or more, 10-plus rebounds, and five assists or more in four separate seasons.[125]"
"On April 20, during Game 2 of the first round of the playoffs, Antetokounmpo logged 33 points, 18 rebounds, 9 assists, and 2 blocks in a 114–110 loss against the Chicago Bulls.

He joined Shaquille O'Neal and Wilt Chamberlain as the only players in NBA playoff history to post a 40/20/5 game.[129][130] The Bucks would go on to lose to Celtics in Game 7 despite Antetokounmpo's 25-point, 20-rebound, and 9-assist outing. He became the first player in NBA history to have 200 points, 100 rebounds, and 50 assists in a playoff series, averaging 33.9 points, 14.7 rebounds, and 7.1 assists against Boston. Antetokounmpo also finished the postseason by averaging 31.7 points, 14.2 rebounds and 6.8 assists across the 12 playoff games his Milwaukee Bucks played. He is therefore the first player in NBA history to average a 31-14-6 line across an entire postseason.[131][132]"
"On May 21, Antetokounmpo was selected to his fourth consecutive NBA All-Defensive First Team, which was the fifth career all-defensive team selection for him. It tied him with Hall of Famer and former two-time NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award winner Sidney Moncrief for most selections in franchise history.[133][134] On May 24, Antetokounmpo was selected to his fourth consecutive All-NBA First Team and sixth consecutive overall.

Antetokounmpo also became just the seventh player with multiple games of 40 points, 20 rebounds, 5 assists and 60% shooting.

He shot 20-of-26 from the field, 3-of-4 from three, 7-of-12 from the free throw line. This marked the 10th time this season that Antetokounmpo has scored at least 40 points, matching the career high he set last year for 40-point games in a single season.[146] On February 2, Antetokounmpo scored 20 of his 54 points in the fourth quarter, along with 19 rebounds and the Milwaukee Bucks overcame a 21-point deficit to beat the Los Angeles Clippers 106–105 for their sixth consecutive victory.

"In the first round of the 2023 NBA playoffs, Antetokounmpo and the Bucks faced the Miami Heat.

"Antetokounmpo again joined the Greek national team for EuroBasket 2015. Greece's roster consisted of many experienced players, most of them previously crowned European champions with their clubs, like Vassilis Spanoulis, Ioannis Bourousis and Nikos Zisis, and Greece was a favorite for a medal, after showing great form in friendly games.[180] At EuroBasket 2015, Greece was unbeaten in the group stages, and reached the quarter-finals, where a tight game ended in favor of the eventual champions, Spain, eventually finishing fifth with a 7–1 record.

"Standing 6 feet 11 inches (2.11 m) tall and weighing 242 pounds (110 kg), Antetokounmpo is officially listed as a forward and sometimes described as a point forward,[199][200][201] but has been deployed across all five positions. Highly athletic and versatile, Antetokounmpo is often recognized as one of the best all-around players in the NBA, and many analysts have declared him ""positionless"" and as embodying the future of the league.[202][203][204]"
"By the 2016–17 season, Antetokounmpo had established himself as one of the league's most devastating slashers and transition scorers.[204][205] His rare combination of size and speed frequently enables him to cross half a court in a single dribble and blowing past multiple defenders.[202][203][206] A 2017 analysis conducted by Stats SportVU at the behest of FiveThirtyEight showed that Antetokounmpo was able to cover slightly more than 15 feet off a single dribble when driving to the basket, 5 feet further than the average player in the league.[201] In addition, Antetokounmpo has developed his own version of the Euro step, described by Jordan Brenner of ESPN.com as ""the final phase of the move's evolution"", which allows him to directly attack the rim from the three-point arc in a move that ""renders the area between the top of the key and the basket all but undefendable"".[207]"
"However, Antetokounmpo has been criticized for his lack of a reliable jump shot, having shot above 31% from three-point range just once in his career. Antetokounmpo's jumper has been exploited by other teams. Most famously, the Toronto Raptors built a 'wall' of lengthy, adept defenders to neutralise Antetokounmpo's paint dominance in their 2019 Conference Finals victory.[208] As a result, Antetokounmpo increased his jump-shooting output, averaging a career-high 4.4 three-point goals attempted and 1.4 made per game in 2019–20.[199]"
"Antetokounmpo has also received attention for his playmaking skills. Despite not being the primary ball handler of the Bucks, he has largely orchestrated the team's offense. During the 2019–20 season, Antetokounmpo was responsible (through assisting and personally scoring) for 57.8% of the points the Bucks scored while he was on the floor, one of the highest rates in the league.[209] He averaged nearly 6 assists per game during both the 2018–19 and 2019–20 seasons.[199]"
"Antetokounmpo is also recognized as an elite defensive player, capable of guarding all five positions but more often deployed in a ""free safety"" role that allows him to roam the paint and discourage attacks on the rim.[210] He is also a proficient shot-blocker and has developed a reputation for blocking opponents in transition (the chase-down block).[211]
With Antetokounmpo in this role, the Bucks have flourished into one of the league's best defensive teams, leading the NBA in defensive rating in 2018–19 and 2019–20.[212][213] For his defensive efforts, Antetokounmpo won the 2020 NBA Defensive Player of the Year, and he has become a perennial NBA All-Defensive honoree.[214]"
"In August 2022, Calamos Advisors announced that they would work with Antetokounmpo on an exchange-traded fund that invests in sustainable firms that would be called the Calamos Antetokounmpo Sustainable Equities Fund.[220]"
"In September 2022, Antetokounmpo joined as an executive producer for National Geographic's documentary The Flagmakers, which focuses on the large population of immigrant employees working at an American flag factory. Antetokounmpo called the project inspiring, saying: ""As an immigrant myself, I find this film incredibly personal and a deeply moving testament to those who call this country 'home'"".[221]"
"Antetokounmpo's father, Charles, was a Nigerian football player, while his mother, Veronica, is a former high jumper.[19] Charles died in September 2017, at age 54.[62] Veronica gave each of her five sons both Greek and Nigerian names, choosing the Nigerian Ugo for Giannis.[222][223] His parents are from different Nigerian ethnic groups—Charles was Yoruba, while Veronica is Igbo. According to basketball great Hakeem Olajuwon, also Yoruba, the original family name of Adétòkunbọ̀ translates to ""the crown has returned from overseas"".[16] Giannis wears the number 34 in honor of his parents, who were born in 1963 and 1964.[224]"
"Antetokounmpo has two older brothers, Francis (Greek name Andreas) and Thanasis, as well as two younger brothers, Kostas and Alex.[225] Antetokounmpo is a Christian and was raised in the Greek Orthodox Church.[226] He was baptized in the Greek Orthodox Church along with his brother Alex on October 28, 2012.[227]"
"Following their son and brother, the entire Antetokounmpo family, except for Francis and Thanasis, moved from Athens to Milwaukee in early 2014.[228] In July 2016, Giannis and Thanasis began their mandatory military service in Greece. The two brothers served a reduced three-month military service, as prescribed for Greek citizens who are permanent overseas residents.[229]"
"Thanasis made his NBA debut with the New York Knicks after being drafted by the organization with the 51st overall pick in the 2014 NBA draft.[230] After playing for Andorra during the 2016–17 season and the Greek EuroLeague powerhouse Panathinaikos for the next two seasons, he signed with the Milwaukee Bucks on July 16, 2019.[231] Antetokounmpo's younger brother, Kostas, played college basketball for Dayton before being selected with the last pick in the 2018 NBA draft.[232] He went on to win the 2020 NBA Championship with the Los Angeles Lakers. In 2021, Kostas signed with ASVEL Basket, part of the French Betclic Élite and the EuroLeague.[233] He currently plays for Panathinaikos in Greece. Their youngest brother, Alex, played high school basketball in the US before becoming a professional basketball player."
"In the mid-2010's, Antetokounmpo began dating Mariah Riddlesprigger, a native of Fresno, California.[234][235] In February 2020, Riddlesprigger gave birth to their first son, Liam.[236] She gave birth to a second son, Maverick, in August 2021,[237][238] and a daughter, Eva, in September 2023.[239] Antetokounmpo and Riddlesprigger got married in a private ceremony on September 1, 2024, at the Costa Navarino resort near Pylos.[240] Milwaukee Bucks teammate Khris Middleton served as the best man."
"On March 13, 2020, Antetokounmpo and his family pledged to give $100,000 to the staff of the Fiserv Forum who were unable to work during the suspension of the 2019–20 NBA season because of the COVID-19 pandemic.[241] Antetokounmpo and his family also donated 20,000 masks to people in Athens and Zografou in Greece in 2020.[242]"

"In June 2023, Giannis and his brothers Thanasis, Kostas and Alex expanded their investment portfolio, overseen by Ante Inc., by becoming shareholders and owners of the Canadian online confectionary retailer, Candy Funhouse.[246]"
"In September 2023, Giannis signed on as an Executive Producer of a reality TV show created by Candy Funhouse and the producers of Big Brother, Fly on the Wall.[247]"
